You Americans are the worst with your imperialist thinking.

This is ACTUALLY VERY GOOD for the Pound Sterling. It's better to have no one IPO when most of these IPO's are either Debt-Backed or based on flashy products and a VERY OBVIOUS A.I/TECH (Crypto) Bubble.

The Wise Brits are actually going to get the better end of this than say, greedy Wall Streeters who allow anyone with a nice smile and an ""Ivy League-Type"" education start a company to scam old folk out of their retirement savings.

That's the problem in the States, you make bad decisions and spread them to the simple minded globally who want to please Fat Sam, then when it inevitably goes bad, which it always does (VIETNAM, SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA, HEALTHCARE, HOLLYWOOD AND THE GROOMERS, 2008 GLOBAL RECESSION, TESLA - BIG TECH AND THE SAD SAD STATE OF THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY), they pay the cost.
