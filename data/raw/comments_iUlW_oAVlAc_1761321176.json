This is why Tesla chose Germany instead of UK for setting up a factory in Europe. Same goes for pretty much every industry these days.",

    "comment": "The demand and supply in the US and UK are different. UK has a more conservative approach too. Its people are very conservative too with a mindset that is very social class conscious. A bit stuck in time. I think the US has dealt with more high risk financial products and have the appropriate legislation for the financial and corporate landscape and for the introduction of any IT tools, methods or products being launched on the market.. The US is more prepared to deal with all that. It has the resources and the expertise. I remember checking precedents on debt restructuring and cross border insolvency in the UK and those in the US- The US has a much better opening on that and far more better techniques and principles on such issues compared to the UK because it is kind of new to the UK-all the precedents are very new and seem to be now being examined. If you compare from both US and UK regulatory and legislative systems in place to deal with the financial landscape, the US wins.",

Its people are very conservative too with a mindset that is very social class conscious. A bit stuck in time. I think the US has dealt with more high risk financial products and have the appropriate legislation for the financial and corporate landscape and for the introduction of any IT tools, methods or products being launched on the market.. The US is more prepared to deal with all that. It has the resources and the expertise. I remember checking precedents on debt restructuring and cross border insolvency in the UK and those in the US- The US has a much better opening on that and far more better techniques and principles on such issues compared to the UK because it is kind of new to the UK-all the precedents are very new and seem to be now being examined. If you compare from both US and UK regulatory and legislative systems in place to deal with the financial landscape, the US wins.",
